    blogTitle: 'What is an IRRRL VA refinance loan',
    blogAuthor:'Hilda Hensley',
    blogText: <p>
An IRRRL, or Interest Rate Reduction Refinancing Loan, is a quick VA refinance option with fewer qualifications and less paperwork than other refinance loan options. It’s meant to be a quick and non-complicated refinance option for qualified VA homeowners, and there is no appraisal requirement. If you have an existing VA loan and are looking for a quick way to refinance at a lower rate or shorten the term of your mortgage, an IRRRL might be a great option for you!

<br/><br/>
<h1>How do I know if I qualify?</h1>
<br/><br/>
To qualify for a IRRRL you must already have an existing VA loan you are looking to refinance. Approval is also very simple. No credit review is needed, making this one of the easiest refinance options available to VA homeowners.

 
<br/><br/>

<h1>Is it worth it? How would I benefit from an IRRRL?</h1>
<br/><br/>

With an IRRRL, you can potentially refinance at a lower interest rate than when your original VA loan was taken out. It gives existing VA homeowners like you a chance to take advantage of the current low interest rates. If you are looking to reduce your monthly mortgage payment this might be a great opportunity.
<br/><br/>

You can also shorten a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage when you refinance with an IRRRL. Be aware that your monthly payment will probably be larger when shortening the term of your mortgage. However, depending on your goals and financial situation, this might be an opportunity to cut your number of mortgage payments significantly. You can also switch from an existing ARM (adjustable-rate mortgage) to a new fixed-rate loan.  
<br/><br/>


 

<h1>How much does it cost? How do I apply?</h1>
<br/><br/>

Before discussing the cost, it’s a good idea to understand what the VA funding fee is, exactly.
<br/><br/>

As we shared in VA Funding Fee: A Closer Look, the VA funding fee is a percentage of the loan amount that is applied to every VA purchase and refinance. The proceeds from the fee go directly to the VA to help keep the loan guarantee program running. While this is a benefit that all veterans have earned, the fee helps to offset any losses that the VA takes on by issuing the guarantee, so that this program will continue to be available for future generations.
<br/><br/>

The amount of paperwork required for this streamlined loan is very minimal. The VA funding fee for an IRRRL only 0.5%, and there is an exception to this for disabled veterans, or spouses of deceased veterans who died in service or from an injury sustained during service.
<br/><br/>

If you are ready to get started with an IRRRL, you find your local branch, and contact them, or apply today! For more information, please contact our VA specialists at 1-833-VET-EASY.

    blogTitle: 'What to do if the Home Appraisal Comes in Low',
    blogAuthor:'Hilda Hensley',
    blogText: <p>
A home appraisal is an important step when buying a home—and one that is absolutely necessary if you’re getting a mortgage. The purpose of the home appraisal is to determine the property’s actual value. Lenders require this, as it’s a way for them to protect their investment.
<br/><br/>
For example, suppose you and the seller agree on a purchase price of $500,000. You are putting $25,000 down, meaning your mortgage will be for $475,000. If the appraisal says the home is valued at $450,000, your lender many deny your application. That’s because there’s a $25,000 gap between the mortgage amount and the home’s value. If you were to default on the loan, chances are high that the mortgage company wouldn’t be able to recoup the full amount of the loss.
<br/><br/>

So, what happens when your home appraisal comes in lower than expected? Is your dream home gone forever? Not necessarily. Here are some things to consider.
<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>
Get your lender involved. Due to mandated mortgage industry requirements, you as a consumer cannot request a new appraisal. However, your lender can rebut an appraisal on your behalf. Therefore, let your lender know why you agreed to the price you did. Show your lender the comparables you and your Realtor used to determine an offer price. If that doesn’t work, consider the next two suggestions. 
  </li> 
<li>Re-negotiate with the seller. If the appraisal stands as is (even with a second opinion), see if the seller will lower the price. After all, unless they find a cash buyer, in which appraisals aren’t needed, they’re going to run into this problem again with a new buyer. </li>
<li>Make up the difference with a higher down payment. If you have the means, you can increase your down payment so that the lender is no longer at risk. </li>
</ol>
<br/><br/>

As you can see, all is not lost if your home appraisal comes in lower than expected. Take the next step that makes the most sense for your situation. And always work closely with your Realtor and mortgage banker to ensure the best outcome for all.

    blogTitle: 'Using Gift Money for Your Down Payment',
    blogAuthor:'Hilda Hensley',
    blogText: <p>
Saving for a down payment can take a long time. However, if you’re fortunate to have family willing to
give you a monetary gift that you can use for your down payment, you can reach your goal of home
ownership must faster.
<br/><br/>
According to the 2017 National Association of REALTORS® Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers report,
nearly 25% of first-time home buyers used cash gifts from family for a down payment. If any family
members are willing to gift you some down payment money, you’ll need to get a signed statement from
the giver that explicitly states the money is a gift, not a loan, and that no repayment is required. The
mortgage gift letter must include the giver’s name, address, and contact information; the recipient’s
name and relationships to the giver; and the dollar amount and approximate date of the gift.
<br/><br/>
Here is a sample gift letter you may be able to use. Your lender may require additional information:
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
To Whom It May Concern:
<br/><br/>
I am giving my son, John Smith, a gift of $7,000 toward the purchase of his home. I do not expect
or require any kind of repayment for this gift. I wrote the check for these funds on July 15, 2019,
and he deposited it the next day. Should you need to contact me regarding this gift, you can do
so using the information below.
<br/><br/>
Sincerely,
<br/><br/>
Michael Smith
<br/>
1234 Main Street
<br/>
Anytown, CA 90210
<br/>
(123) 555-4459
</div>
<br/><br/>
Whatever you do, don’t take a loan from family and try to pass it off as a gift. If it needs to be repaid at
any time in the future, it’s a loan and not a gift. If the money really is a loan, your lender will need to
factor that amount into your debt-to-income ratio.
<br/><br/>
The good news is an individual can give up to $14,000 to an unlimited number of people each year and
still face no federal gift tax. In other words, two parents could each give a son and daughter-in-law
$14,000. That’s $28,000 per person, or $56,000 total. That’s a big down payment.
<br/><br/>
So don’t be afraid to ask Mom or Dad (or your favorite aunt or uncle) if a gift is possible. It may help you
get that home of your dreams sooner than you ever thought possible.
