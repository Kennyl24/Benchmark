    blogTitle: 'What to do if the Home Appraisal Comes in Low',
    blogAuthor:'Hilda Hensley',
    blogText: <p>
A home appraisal is an important step when buying a home—and one that is absolutely necessary if you’re getting a mortgage. The purpose of the home appraisal is to determine the property’s actual value. Lenders require this, as it’s a way for them to protect their investment.
<br/><br/>
For example, suppose you and the seller agree on a purchase price of $500,000. You are putting $25,000 down, meaning your mortgage will be for $475,000. If the appraisal says the home is valued at $450,000, your lender many deny your application. That’s because there’s a $25,000 gap between the mortgage amount and the home’s value. If you were to default on the loan, chances are high that the mortgage company wouldn’t be able to recoup the full amount of the loss.
<br/><br/>

So, what happens when your home appraisal comes in lower than expected? Is your dream home gone forever? Not necessarily. Here are some things to consider.
<br/><br/>
<ol>
<li>
Get your lender involved. Due to mandated mortgage industry requirements, you as a consumer cannot request a new appraisal. However, your lender can rebut an appraisal on your behalf. Therefore, let your lender know why you agreed to the price you did. Show your lender the comparables you and your Realtor used to determine an offer price. If that doesn’t work, consider the next two suggestions. 
  </li> 
<li>Re-negotiate with the seller. If the appraisal stands as is (even with a second opinion), see if the seller will lower the price. After all, unless they find a cash buyer, in which appraisals aren’t needed, they’re going to run into this problem again with a new buyer. </li>
<li>Make up the difference with a higher down payment. If you have the means, you can increase your down payment so that the lender is no longer at risk. </li>
</ol>
<br/><br/>

As you can see, all is not lost if your home appraisal comes in lower than expected. Take the next step that makes the most sense for your situation. And always work closely with your Realtor and mortgage banker to ensure the best outcome for all.

    blogTitle: 'Using Gift Money for Your Down Payment',
    blogAuthor:'Hilda Hensley',
    blogText: <p>
Saving for a down payment can take a long time. However, if you’re fortunate to have family willing to
give you a monetary gift that you can use for your down payment, you can reach your goal of home
ownership must faster.
<br/><br/>
According to the 2017 National Association of REALTORS® Profile of Home Buyers and Sellers report,
nearly 25% of first-time home buyers used cash gifts from family for a down payment. If any family
members are willing to gift you some down payment money, you’ll need to get a signed statement from
the giver that explicitly states the money is a gift, not a loan, and that no repayment is required. The
mortgage gift letter must include the giver’s name, address, and contact information; the recipient’s
name and relationships to the giver; and the dollar amount and approximate date of the gift.
<br/><br/>
Here is a sample gift letter you may be able to use. Your lender may require additional information:
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
To Whom It May Concern:
<br/><br/>
I am giving my son, John Smith, a gift of $7,000 toward the purchase of his home. I do not expect
or require any kind of repayment for this gift. I wrote the check for these funds on July 15, 2019,
and he deposited it the next day. Should you need to contact me regarding this gift, you can do
so using the information below.
<br/><br/>
Sincerely,
<br/><br/>
Michael Smith
<br/>
1234 Main Street
<br/>
Anytown, CA 90210
<br/>
(123) 555-4459
</div>
<br/><br/>
Whatever you do, don’t take a loan from family and try to pass it off as a gift. If it needs to be repaid at
any time in the future, it’s a loan and not a gift. If the money really is a loan, your lender will need to
factor that amount into your debt-to-income ratio.
<br/><br/>
The good news is an individual can give up to $14,000 to an unlimited number of people each year and
still face no federal gift tax. In other words, two parents could each give a son and daughter-in-law
$14,000. That’s $28,000 per person, or $56,000 total. That’s a big down payment.
<br/><br/>
So don’t be afraid to ask Mom or Dad (or your favorite aunt or uncle) if a gift is possible. It may help you
get that home of your dreams sooner than you ever thought possible.

    blogTitle: 'The Facts about Lender Placed Insurance',
    blogAuthor:'Hilda Hensley',
    blogText: <p>
      All mortgage lenders require homeowners to have adequate insurance on the property. This protects
the homeowner as well as the mortgage company, which has a vested interest in the home. At some
point during your home ownership, you may receive notice that your lender has issued “Lender Placed
Insurance,” “Creditor Placed Insurance,” or “Force Placed Insurance” on your property. What is this?
And why would a mortgage company make this move?
<br/><br/>
Typically, there are three main reasons why Lender Placed Insurance may go into effect.
<br/><br/>
<ol>
  <li>
Your current homeowner’s insurance has lapsed or been cancelled. If your insurance payments
are not escrowed and you pay them yourself each year, you may have mistakenly missed your
payment date. Or perhaps your insurance company cancelled your policy for some other reason.
While you would likely receive several notifications prior to any termination of coverage,
oversights happen and your life is busy. So sometimes things get missed. In this case, your
mortgage company would jump in and secure this insurance for you.
</li>
<li>
Your property insurance doesn’t provide adequate coverage. Maybe your home has significantly
risen in value, but you haven’t updated your homeowner’s insurance coverage in years. If your
policy no longer provides adequate protection from a loss, your mortgage company would issue
Lender Placed Insurance to fill in the gap.
</li>
<li>
Your bank or mortgage servicer has no record of adequate homeowner’s insurance coverage.
Your insurance company should provide your mortgage company with proof of coverage. If they
fail to do so, or something gets overlooked, your mortgage company will think you don’t have
insurance and will issue a policy.
</li>
<br/><br/>
It’s important to note that Lender Placed Insurance is meant to be temporary. It’s usually basic coverage
that only offers protection for the lender for the loan balance should a major loss occur. Additionally,
this basic coverage is often more expensive than a traditional homeowner policy, and you as the
homeowner are responsible for paying the premium of the Lender Placed Insurance.
<br/><br/>
Once you have proof that your property is covered by traditional homeowner’s insurance, your
mortgage company will promptly cancel the Lender Placed Insurance. So if you receive a notice of
Lender Placed Insurance, address it right away to ensure your home is properly insured.
